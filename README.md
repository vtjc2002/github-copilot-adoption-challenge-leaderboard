# LeaderboardApp - GitHub Copilot Adoption Challenge
## Overview
LeaderboardApp is a web application designed to track and manage scores for individual participants and teams in the GitHub Copilot Adoption Challenge. The application leverages configurable weights for different activities, allowing scores to be adjusted dynamically based on the type of activity and its importance.

The app is structured to provide real-time updates to the leaderboard, ensuring that both individual contributions and team performances are accurately reflected. Participants and teams earn scores by completing various activities, which are recorded in the system. The app is fully integrated with Docker for easy deployment and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Key Features
* **Participant and Team Management**: The app allows you to manage participants and teams, associating them with specific activities that contribute to their scores.
* **Activity-Based Scoring** Scores are assigned based on activities performed by participants or teams. Each activity has a configurable weight (fixed or multiplier) to reflect its importance.
* **Leaderboard**: A Leaderboard View that updates based on the activities recorded for participants and teams.
* **Daily Summaries**: Teams can submit daily github copilot summaries of their activities, which are factored into their overall score. (GitHub API integration coming soon)
* **Configurable Scoring Weights**: The app allows the configuration of scoring weights for different activities, enabling flexible and customizable scoring systems.

<!-----------------------[  Installing  ]-------------------<optional> section below------------------>
### Installing - Quick Deployment to Azure

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS:
- A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment and your code running. 
- Best practice is to include examples that can be copy and pasted directly from the README into a terminal.

How to Evaluate & Examples:
  - https://aka.ms/StartRight/README-Template/Instructions#installing

<!---- [TODO]  CONTENT GOES BELOW ------->
Deploy the entire application with a few commands using Azure Developer CLI and PowerShell scripts:

```bash
## set the necessary environment variables first.  Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values.
pwsh ./setup-azd.ps1 -TenantId <tenant-id> -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -Location <azure-region> -EnvironmentName <env-name>
## run azd up to deploy the infra and app
azd up
## execute sql script to grant web app the db roles
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/grant-sql-managed-identity-roles.ps1 
## execute sql script to add seed data
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/seed-database.ps1
## create app registration name LeaderboardApp-<env-name> in azure and update web app settings
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/app-reg-setup.ps1 -passwordDaysToExpiration <number of days before password expires>

```

This will provision all Azure infrastructure (App Service, SQL Database, VNet, Key Vault) and deploy your application in one step. 

_the script adds the ip address of your current machine to the sql server firewall rules so that the sql scripts can be executed successfully.  It also adds the ip address to the web app firewall rules.  Make sure to update your firewall rules accordingly after the deployment/setup._

Use below command to get the web app URL after deployment:
```bash
azd env get-value APP_SERVICE_HOST
```

Now all you have to do is to review and [add challenges](./DEPLOYMENT.md#initialize-sample-challenges-optional)

💻**Technical Overview**: See [TechnicalOverview.md](./TechnicalOverview.md) for architecture and component details.  Also app configuration settings.

📖 **Detailed Step-by-Step Guide**: See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for comprehensive instructions as well as optional features such as SMTP email or GitHub connection.  Troubleshooting tips are also included.  Note that the deployment scripts above does all the non-optional steps for you already when you deploy.



**Alternative deployment options:**
- **Step-by-step**: Use `azd provision` then `azd deploy` for more control
- **Local development**: Use Docker and PostgreSQL (see prerequisites section)

### Deployment (CI/CD)

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Describe how to deploy if applicable. Deployment includes website deployment, packages, or artifacts.
- Avoid potential new contributor frustrations by making it easy to know about all compliance and continuous integration 
    that will be run before pull request approval.
- NOTE: Setting up an Azure DevOps pipeline gets you all 1ES compliance and build tooling such as component governance.
