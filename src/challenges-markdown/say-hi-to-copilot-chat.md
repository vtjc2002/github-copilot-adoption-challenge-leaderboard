Title: Say hi to Copilot Chat
ActivityId: 12
---

## Summary

In this exercise you will use **GitHub Copilot Chat** to understand and improve code that already exists in your repository. You will select a confusing block, ask Copilot Chat to explain it, then request a simpler rewrite. The entire task should take about twenty minutes.

## What you will learn

- Opening Copilot Chat inside your IDE.

- Sending prompts that refer to selected code.

- Asking follow up questions to refine Copilot responses.

- Evaluating and applying a suggested rewrite to your own code.

## Prerequisites

Confirm that Copilot Chat is enabled in **your IDE** (use the Copilot sidebar in VS Code or the Copilot Chat tool window in JetBrains and Visual Studio). Work inside a repository you own or have permission to change.

## Steps

- **Step 1.** Select a block of code that you find hard to read or overly complex.

- **Step 2.** With the code still highlighted open the Copilot Chat panel. In VS Code choose **Copilot Chat** from the Activity Bar. In JetBrains use **View > Tool Windows > Copilot Chat**.

- **Step 3.** Type `Explain what this does` and press Enter. Read Copilotâ€™s explanation and make sure it matches your intention.

- **Step 4.** In the same conversation type `Can you suggest a simpler rewrite`. Copilot will return a refactored version of the selected code.

- **Step 5.** Compare the suggested code with the original. If you prefer the new version paste it over the old block then run your tests or build command.

- **Step 6.** Commit the change with a clear message. You can pause at the commit prompt and let Copilot propose a message if you wish.
