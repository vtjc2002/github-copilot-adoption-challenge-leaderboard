Title: Performance profiler assistant
ActivityId: 12
---

## Summary

In this performance tuning exercise you will choose a slow running method in your codebase and use **GitHub Copilot Chat in EDIT mode** to instrument it with a profiler in your language of choice. Copilot will then propose optimisations. You will benchmark the method before and after the changes to confirm an improvement. Plan roughly twenty minutes.

## What you will learn

- Selecting and benchmarking a performance hotspot.

- Prompting Copilot Chat to add profiler instrumentation.

- Applying AI suggested optimisations safely.

- Comparing benchmark results before and after the refactor.

## Before you start

Confirm Copilot Chat is enabled in **your IDE** such as VS Code JetBrains or Visual Studio. Ensure you have a profiling tool available for your language for example `timeit` in Python BenchmarkDotNet in C Sharp or Node `node --prof`.

## Steps

- **Step 1.** Identify a method that is noticeably slow during normal execution or profiling.

- **Step 2.** Benchmark the current implementation. For Python run `python -m timeit -s "from module import slow_method" "slow_method()"` or use your language equivalent. Record the result.

- **Step 3.** Highlight the entire method then open Copilot Chat and type `Instrument this method with the built in profiler and suggest optimisations` then press Enter.

- **Step 4.** Copilot will insert profiling code and list possible improvements such as memoisation avoiding redundant loops or using more efficient data structures. Accept the instrumentation first run it and observe the hottest lines.

- **Step 5.** Apply one optimisation at a time following Copilotâ€™s suggestions. Save your changes after each edit.

- **Step 6.** Benchmark the optimised method using the same command as in Step 2. Compare the new runtime with the original.

- **Step 7.** Once you confirm a measurable improvement commit the changes with a clear message possibly generated by Copilot.

## Checkpoint

1. Did Copilot add profiler instrumentation without syntax errors

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

2. Did the optimised method run faster than the original benchmark

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

3. Did you commit the profiler code removal or keep a clean final version

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
