## Summary

In this keyboard only challenge you will add a small new function to your project using GitHub Copilot completions without touching the mouse. You will use shortcut keys to cycle through suggestions accept code and record how long the task takes. Plan about fifteen minutes.

## What you will learn

- Starting Copilot inline completions with the keyboard.

- Moving through alternative suggestions using `Alt ]` or `Option ]`.

- Accepting code with `Tab` and dismissing with `Esc`.

- Measuring productivity gains when you avoid the mouse.

## Prerequisites

Ensure GitHub Copilot is active in **your IDE** (VS Code JetBrains Visual Studio or Neovim). Check that the inline completion shortcuts match your keymap. Have a stopwatch or phone timer ready.

## Steps

- **Step 1.** Decide on a simple new function for example `calculateAverage` that you can add to an existing file.

- **Step 2.** Start your timer then move the cursor to the location where the new function should go.

- **Step 3.** Type the function signature and pause. When Copilot shows a suggestion press **Tab** to accept or use **Alt ]** or **Option ]** to view other completions.

- **Step 4.** Continue using only the keyboard to build out the body of the function. Use **Esc** to reject any unwanted lines and type more context as needed.

- **Step 5.** Stop the timer when the function completes after edits. Note the time and write it down.

- **Step 6.** Run your normal tests or build command to confirm the new function works.

- **Step 7.** Commit the change. You may let Copilot suggest the commit message by pausing at the prompt.
