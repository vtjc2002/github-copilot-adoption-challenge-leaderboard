# LeaderboardApp - GitHub Copilot Adoption Challenge
## Overview
LeaderboardApp is a web application designed to track and manage scores for individual participants and teams in the GitHub Copilot Adoption Challenge. The application leverages configurable weights for different activities, allowing scores to be adjusted dynamically based on the type of activity and its importance.

The app is structured to provide real-time updates to the leaderboard, ensuring that both individual contributions and team performances are accurately reflected. Participants and teams earn scores by completing various activities, which are recorded in the system. The app is fully integrated with Docker for easy deployment and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Key Features
* **Participant and Team Management**: The app allows you to manage participants and teams, associating them with specific activities that contribute to their scores.
* **Activity-Based Scoring** Scores are assigned based on activities performed by participants or teams. Each activity has a configurable weight (fixed or multiplier) to reflect its importance.
* **Leaderboard**: A Leaderboard View that updates based on the activities recorded for participants and teams.
* **Daily Summaries**: Teams can submit daily github copilot summaries of their activities, which are factored into their overall score. (GitHub API integration coming soon)
* **Configurable Scoring Weights**: The app allows the configuration of scoring weights for different activities, enabling flexible and customizable scoring systems.

## Getting Started

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Write instructions such that any new user can get the project up & running on their machine.
  - This section has subsections described further down of "Prerequisites", "Installing", and "Deployment".

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before You Begin**: Please read the [Security and Privacy Statement](./PRIVACY-STATEMENT.md) before deploying this application.

### Quick Deployment to Azure

Deploy the entire application with a single command using Azure Developer CLI:

```bash
## set the necessary environment variables first.  Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values.
pwsh ./setup-azd.ps1 -TenantId <tenant-id> -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -Location <azure-region> -EnvironmentName <env-name>
## run azd up
azd up
## execute sql script to grant web app the db roles
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/grant-sql-managed-identity-roles.ps1 
## execute sql script to add seed data
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/seed-database.ps1
## create app registration name LeaderboardApp-<env-name> in azure and update web app settings
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/app-reg-setup.ps1 -passwordDaysToExpiration <number of days before password expires>

```

This will provision all Azure infrastructure (App Service, SQL Database, VNet, Key Vault) and deploy your application in one step.

**Post-deployment configuration required (one-time, ~15 minutes):**
1. **SQL Database Permissions**: Grant the App Service managed identity database access via Azure Portal (~5 min)
2. **Azure AD Authentication**: Create an App Registration and configure ClientId/TenantId/ClientSecret (~10 min)

ÔøΩ **Configuration Checklist**: See [CONFIGURATION-CHECKLIST.md](./CONFIGURATION-CHECKLIST.md) for complete requirements validation

üìñ **Detailed Step-by-Step Guide**: See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for comprehensive instructions

**Alternative deployment options:**
- **Step-by-step**: Use `azd provision` then `azd deploy` for more control
- **Local development**: Use Docker and PostgreSQL (see prerequisites below)

### Deployment (CI/CD)

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Describe how to deploy if applicable. Deployment includes website deployment, packages, or artifacts.
- Avoid potential new contributor frustrations by making it easy to know about all compliance and continuous integration 
    that will be run before pull request approval.
- NOTE: Setting up an Azure DevOps pipeline gets you all 1ES compliance and build tooling such as component governance.

<!-----------------------[  Access  ]-----------------------<recommended> section below------------------>
## Access

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Please use this section to reduce the all-too-common friction & pain of getting read access and role-based permissions 
  to repos inside Microsoft. Please cover (a) Gaining a role with read, write, other permissions. (b) sharing a link to 
  this repository such that people who are not members of the organization can access it.
- If the repository is set to internalVisibility, you may also want to refer to the "Sharing a Link to this Repository" sub-section 
of the [README-Template instructions](https://aka.ms/StartRight/README-Template/Instructions#sharing-a-link-to-this-repository) so new GitHub EMU users know to get 1ES-Enterprise-Visibility MyAccess group access and therefore will have read rights to any repo set to internalVisibility.

<!---- [TODO]  CONTENT GOES BELOW ------->
_This repository prefers outside contributors start forks rather than branches. For pull requests more complicated 
than typos, it is often best to submit an issue first._

If you are a new potential collaborator who finds reaching out or contributing to another project awkward, you may find 
it useful to read these [tips & tricks](https://aka.ms/StartRight/README-Template/innerSource/2021_02_TipsAndTricksForCollaboration)
