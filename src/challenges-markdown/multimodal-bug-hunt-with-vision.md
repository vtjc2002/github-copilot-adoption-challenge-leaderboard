Title: Multimodal bug hunt with Vision
ActivityId: 12
---

## Summary

In this multimodal bug hunt you will capture a screenshot of a visual bug in your own application and feed it to **GitHub Copilot Agent mode with Vision Preview**. The Agent will compare the screenshot to the Figma design export checked into your repository and propose code fixes. You will apply the patch then verify the UI renders correctly. Reserve about twenty minutes.

## What you will learn

- Capturing and attaching UI screenshots to Copilot Chat Vision.

- Referencing a Figma design export stored in the repo.

- Prompting the Agent to generate code fixes based on visual differences.

- Running and visually verifying the application after applying the patch.

## Before you start

Install the latest **GitHub Copilot Nightly** extension in VS Code and enable both Agent mode and Vision Preview under **Settings > GitHub Copilot**. Ensure your repository contains the Figma design export for the affected screen for example `design/login-page.png`. Start your development server with `npm start` `yarn dev` or similar so you can reproduce the bug.

## Steps

- **Step 1.** Reproduce the visual bug in your browser then take a screenshot (for example `bug.png`) and save it in the repo under `docs/bugs/`.

- **Step 2.** Create a new branch named `vision-bugfix` with `git checkout -b vision-bugfix` or via the source control panel.

- **Step 3.** Open Copilot Chat and switch to **Agent** mode.

- **Step 4.** Drag `docs/bugs/bug.png` into the chat box. After the thumbnail appears drag the Figma export `design/login-page.png` into the same prompt.

- **Step 5.** Type `Compare the bug screenshot to the Figma design and propose code fixes` then press Enter.

- **Step 6.** Review the plan and patch the Agent suggests. Accept the patch with **Tab** or paste it into the correct file then save changes.

- **Step 7.** Refresh the browser running the dev server to confirm the UI now matches the design.

- **Step 8.** Commit the fix with a descriptive message generated by you or drafted by Copilot then push the branch and open a pull request.
