# LeaderboardApp - GitHub Copilot Adoption Challenge
## Overview
LeaderboardApp is a web application designed to track and manage scores for individual participants and teams in the GitHub Copilot Adoption Challenge. The application leverages configurable weights for different activities, allowing scores to be adjusted dynamically based on the type of activity and its importance.

The app is structured to provide real-time updates to the leaderboard, ensuring that both individual contributions and team performances are accurately reflected. Participants and teams earn scores by completing various activities, which are recorded in the system. The app is fully integrated with Docker for easy deployment and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Key Features
* **Participant and Team Management**: The app allows you to manage participants and teams, associating them with specific activities that contribute to their scores.
* **Activity-Based Scoring** Scores are assigned based on activities performed by participants or teams. Each activity has a configurable weight (fixed or multiplier) to reflect its importance.
* **Leaderboard**: A Leaderboard View that updates based on the activities recorded for participants and teams.
* **Daily Summaries**: Teams can submit daily github copilot summaries of their activities, which are factored into their overall score. (GitHub API integration coming soon)
* **Configurable Scoring Weights**: The app allows the configuration of scoring weights for different activities, enabling flexible and customizable scoring systems.

## Getting Started

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
  - Write instructions such that any new user can get the project up & running on their machine.
  - This section has subsections described further down of "Prerequisites", "Installing", and "Deployment".

<!-----------------------[ Prerequisites  ]-----------------<optional> section below--------------------->
### Prerequisites

<!--------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Describe what things a new user needs to install in order to install and use the repository. 

How to Evaluate & Examples:
  - https://aka.ms/StartRight/README-Template/Instructions#prerequisites
---------------------------------------------------------->

<!---- [TODO]  CONTENT GOES BELOW ------->
1. Install Azure Developer CLI (azd): https://aka.ms/azd-install
1. Install Azure CLI: https://aka.ms/azcli-install  
1. Have an Azure subscription

For local development, you will also need:
* [Docker or orchestration engine like Kubernetes to run the LeaderboardApp container](https://www.docker.com/)
* [PostgresSQL running as a container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

<!-----------------------[  Installing  ]-------------------<optional> section below------------------>
### Installing - Quick Deployment to Azure

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS:
- A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment and your code running. 
- Best practice is to include examples that can be copy and pasted directly from the README into a terminal.

How to Evaluate & Examples:
  - https://aka.ms/StartRight/README-Template/Instructions#installing

<!---- [TODO]  CONTENT GOES BELOW ------->
Deploy the entire application with a single command using Azure Developer CLI:

```bash
## set the necessary environment variables first.  Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values.
pwsh ./setup-azd.ps1 -TenantId <tenant-id> -SubscriptionId <subscription-id> -Location <azure-region> -EnvironmentName <env-name>
## run azd up to deploy the infra and app
azd up
## execute sql script to grant web app the db roles
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/grant-sql-managed-identity-roles.ps1 
## execute sql script to add seed data
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/seed-database.ps1
## create app registration name LeaderboardApp-<env-name> in azure and update web app settings
pwsh ./src/infra/scripts/app-reg-setup.ps1 -passwordDaysToExpiration <number of days before password expires>

```

This will provision all Azure infrastructure (App Service, SQL Database, VNet, Key Vault) and deploy your application in one step.

_the script adds the ip address of your current machine to the sql server firewall rules so that the sql scripts can be executed successfully.  It also adds the ip address to the web app firewall rules.  Make sure to update your firewall rules accordingly after the deployment/setup._

Use below command to get the web app URL after deployment:
```bash
azd env get-value APP_SERVICE_HOST
```

ðŸ’»**Technical Overview**: See [TechnicalOverview.md](./TechnicalOverview.md) for architecture and component details.  Also app configuration settings.

ðŸ“– **Detailed Step-by-Step Guide**: See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for comprehensive instructions as well as optional features such as SMTP email or GitHub connection.  Troubleshooting tips are also included.  Note that the deployment scripts above does all the non-optional steps for you already when you deploy.



**Alternative deployment options:**
- **Step-by-step**: Use `azd provision` then `azd deploy` for more control
- **Local development**: Use Docker and PostgreSQL (see prerequisites section)

### Understanding the Scoring System

The Activities table defines how different GitHub Copilot activities contribute to team scores:

**Weight Types:**
- **Multiplier**: Score = Activity count Ã— Weight (e.g., 10 chats Ã— 10.00 = 100 points)
- **Fixed**: Score = Weight regardless of count (e.g., completing certification = 1000 points)

**Scopes:**
- **User**: Individual participant activity
- **Team**: Aggregated team activity

**Frequencies:**
- **Daily**: Activity tracked and scored every day
- **Once**: One-time achievement (e.g., certifications)

**Default Weights (Customizable):**

| Activity | Weight | Type | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------|------|----------------|
| ActiveUsersPerDay | 50.00 | Multiplier | Encourages daily engagement |
| EngagedUsersPerDay | 75.00 | Multiplier | Rewards active participation |
| TotalCodeSuggestions | 1.00 | Multiplier | Tracks basic usage |
| TotalLinesAccepted | 1.50 | Multiplier | Rewards accepting suggestions |
| TotalChats | 10.00 | Multiplier | Encourages using Chat features |
| TotalChatInsertions | 50.00 | Multiplier | Rewards code insertions from Chat |
| TotalChatCopyEvents | 30.00 | Multiplier | Tracks code copying from Chat |
| TotalPRSummariesCreated | 100.00 | Multiplier | Encourages PR documentation |
| TotalDotComChats | 20.00 | Multiplier | Rewards using GitHub.com Chat |
| CompletedLearningModule | 250.00 | Fixed | Recognizes training completion |
| GitHubCopilotCertificationExam | 1000.00 | Fixed | Highest reward for certification |
| CopilotDailyChallengeCompleted | 200.00 | Fixed | Daily challenge incentive |
| LinkClicked | 50.00 | Fixed | Engagement tracking |
| TeamBonus | 50.00 | Fixed | Team collaboration bonus |

> **ðŸ’¡ Customization Tip:** You can adjust these weights based on what's most important to your organization. For example:
> - Increase `GitHubCopilotCertificationExam` to 2000 to emphasize certification
> - Increase `TotalPRSummariesCreated` to encourage better documentation
> - Adjust `TotalChats` vs `TotalCodeSuggestions` to prioritize different features

### Deployment (CI/CD)

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Describe how to deploy if applicable. Deployment includes website deployment, packages, or artifacts.
- Avoid potential new contributor frustrations by making it easy to know about all compliance and continuous integration
