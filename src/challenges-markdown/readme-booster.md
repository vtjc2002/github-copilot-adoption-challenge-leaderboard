### Summary

In this activity you will use **GitHub Copilot Chat** to add a new Setup or Contributing section to your project Readme. Copilot will draft the content you will review and edit then commit the updated file. Plan about fifteen minutes.

### What you will learn

- Prompting Copilot Chat to generate markdown content.

- Editing AI generated text to match project style.

- Committing documentation changes to the repository.

- Previewing markdown to verify formatting.

### Prerequisites

Confirm Copilot Chat is active in **your IDE** such as VS Code JetBrains or Visual Studio. Ensure your repository has a Readme in the root folder.

### Steps

- **Step 1.** Open `README.md` at the top of your project and place the cursor where the new section should go.

- **Step 2.** Open Copilot Chat and type `Draft a Setup section for this #codebase` or `Draft a Contributing section for this #codebase` then press Enter.

- **Step 3.** Review the markdown Copilot returns. Use **Tab** to accept or copy and paste only the parts you need.

- **Step 4.** Edit headings code blocks and command references to fit your tooling and style.

- **Step 5.** Preview the markdown in your IDE to confirm links and formatting look correct.

- **Step 6.** Stage the updated Readme with `git add README.md` or via the source control view.

- **Step 7.** Commit the change letting Copilot suggest the commit message if you wish then push to remote.
