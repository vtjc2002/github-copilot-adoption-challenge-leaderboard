Title: Security lens starter

## Summary

In this security focused exercise you will copy a data access function from your repository that may contain a vulnerability. You will ask **GitHub Copilot Chat** to identify potential OWASP risks and provide a safer version of the code. Finally you will write a quick unit test to confirm the fix works. Allocate about twenty minutes.

## What you will learn

- Sending real code snippets to Copilot Chat for security analysis.

- Mapping identified issues to OWASP categories.

- Generating a safer refactor that mitigates the risk.

- Writing a simple unit test to validate the secure behaviour.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Copilot Chat is enabled in **your IDE** for example VS Code JetBrains or Visual Studio. Confirm your project has a working test runner such as Jest PyTest JUnit or xUnit.

## Steps

- **Step 1.** In your code, select a data access function that may be vulnerable for example one that concatenates user input into a SQL string.

- **Step 2.** Open Copilot Chat, note how the selected line numbers are automatically included and type `Identify OWASP risks and provide a safer version` then press Enter.

- **Step 3.** Review the risks Copilot lists such as SQL Injection or Insecure Deserialization. Examine the safer code suggestion.

- **Step 4.** Accept the secure refactor or copy it into a new branch for example `security-fix`.

- **Step 5.** Ask Copilot Chat `Write a unit test that proves the fix blocks the vulnerability` then save the test file in your test directory.

- **Step 6.** Run your tests with `npm test` `pytest` or `dotnet test`. Confirm they pass.

- **Step 7.** Commit the secure code and tests with a descriptive message drafted by you or suggested by Copilot.

## Checkpoint

1. Did Copilot correctly highlight at least one OWASP risk in your original code

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

2. Did you implement the safer version without breaking existing functionality

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

3. Did the new unit test pass confirming the vulnerability is mitigated

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
