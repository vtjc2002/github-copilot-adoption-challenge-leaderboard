Title: PRD - Stories - Code (voice-first)
ActivityId: 12
---

## Summary

In this end-to-end workflow you will start with a lightweight Product Requirements Document named `product-x.prd.md`. Using **GitHub Copilot Chat in Agent mode with voice input**you will:

- Extract epics user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Draft a Gherkin specification.
- Scaffold initial code stubs and tests on a new branch.
- Review the output, commit, and open a pull request.
- Plan about thirty minutes.

## What you will learn

- Writing a concise PRD in markdown.

- Using Copilot Chat voice input to issue multi step prompts.

- Converting product language into epics user stories and Gherkin specs.

- Generating starter code and tests directly from requirements.

## Before you start

Enable microphone permissions for Copilot Chat in VS Code. Confirm you have write access to the repository and an available test runner (Jest PyTest JUnit or similar). Create `docs/product-x.prd.md` with a brief description of the new feature.

## Steps

- **Step 1.** Create and check out a branch called `feature-product-x` using `git checkout -b feature-product-x`.

- **Step 2.** Open Copilot Chat and click the microphone icon (or press the assigned shortcut) then dictate: `Extract epics user stories and acceptance criteria from docs/product-x.prd.md`. Wait for Copilot to return structured lists.

- **Step 3.** With voice still active ask: `Draft a Gherkin specification for these stories`. Accept the generated `product-x.feature` file into `tests/features/`.

- **Step 4.** Speak: `Scaffold initial code stubs and unit tests in src/productX/`. Copilot adds empty classes functions and matching test files.

- **Step 5.** Run your test suite with `npm test` `pytest` or equivalent. All tests should fail gracefully indicating todo stubs that await implementation.

- **Step 6.** Stage all new files with `git add docs/product-x.prd.md src/ tests/` then commit. Let Copilot draft the commit message.

- **Step 7.** Push the branch and open a pull request titled `feat: scaffold Product X epics stories Gherkin and stubs`.
